The -m tells Git to take the following text and insert it as a commit message. Without the -m we'll be prompted to add our commit message in the system default (usually VIM). If you get in that situation, here's a list of VIM commands (http://www.radford.edu/~mhtay/CPSC120/VIM_Editor_Commands.htm) to write your message and then exit the program. You can also add Sublime Text or your other text editor by following these instructions (https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/)."

For more information, checkout the Git documentation on branching (http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Branching). Going forward, it's your option whether you want to branch and merge your code, but it's a good habit to get into as you start building more complex scripts."
