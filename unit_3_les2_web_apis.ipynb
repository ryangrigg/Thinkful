    "An application programmer interface (API) is an interface that allows two computer systems to easily exchange information. A client requests information from a server, the server processes the request, and sends a response to the client. The request can be to access data matching a particular criteria, in which case the response will contain the data requested. The request can also be to add data to the server's system. In this case, the response is a simple indication whether the data was successfully added.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of this like a fast food window. You pull up and make a request at the window. You don't need to know what happens in the kitchen (and probably don't want to know). What you requested is delivered to you, and you go about your business. The same is true for an API.Most APIs use a standard URL string to carry the information necessary for the request. This usually involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a service endpoint\n",
    "* query parameters\n",
    "* authentication tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Each API uses a different service endpoint. This will usually be the base URL for the request. Some APIs may only offer a single service, while others may offer many, requiring you to specify the service you wish to query. For example, the service endpoint for the Twitter search is \"https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json\". The first part (\"https://api.twitter.com/\") specifies the URL to access the service. The next part \"1.1\" specifies the API version being used. The service (\"search\") is indicated next, as is the target (\"tweets\"), and the desired return time (\"json\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Query parameters usually begin at the end of the service endpoint and start with a \"?\". Parameters could include a particular user or term to be searched. It could also include a location. For example, given a area, you can search for tweets that were posted at or near that point. In the Foursquare API, that would look like this: \"https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search?intent=browse&v=20140625&ll=40.7021015456,-74.0122357117&radius=100&limit=50\". In this case, the service endpoint for the venue search service is \"https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search\". The parameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"intent=browse\" - indicating we're browsing the venues for a given area\n",
    "* \"v=20140625\" - indicating the version of the API we're intending to use\n",
    "* \"ll=40.7021015456,-74.0122357117\" - indicating the location we want to query around\n",
    "* \"radius=100\" - indicating the radius around the point we want to query\n",
    "* \"limit=50\" - indicating the number of results to display (in most cases, there is a preset max number that can be returned per query)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some APIs have a parameter known as \"offset\" that allow you to page through results. In this case, after we get the first 50 results, we can set the offset to 50 so we get the next 50 results from the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the parameters are combined together using the ampersand (\"&\"). While this tends to be the preferred method for combining search parameters, always check the documentation and find examples in order to construct your own API calls. You may need to prototype the calls in your text editor and run them in your browser before you run them in your code. This allows you to fix minor formatting errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication tokens identify the application accessing the service. In some cases, the token is just a simple identifier so the service knows which user is accessing the system. In other cases, there is a more robust authentication system with multiple authentication tokens to not only identify the user but secure access to the system on that users behalf. Many APIs are free, but some, especially those run by commercial services, charge a fee for access. In some cases, this is based on usage or a flat fee for access.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following lesson, you will practice registering for access tokens, composing an API request, and submitting the API request with Python. Often the API requests can be complex and the responses full of information that needs to be parsed. While you can parse the data in a text editor, Python is far more powerful a tool and for making multiple requests, the ability to script tasks and run them in loop, makes the operation far easier than handling the requests by hand. Adding in the storage component in SQLite makes the task even easier.\n",
