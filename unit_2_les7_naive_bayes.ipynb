    "The posterior probability is basically the probability that an observation belongs to some class based on its observed feature values. To give an example: What is the probability that a person has diabetes given a pre-breakfast blood glucose measurement of x and a post-breakfast blood glucose measurement of y? In the Naive Bayes model, classifications are made based on the most probable hypothesis.\n",

    "Bayesian inference introduces an additional prior probability (or just prior) that can be interpreted as prior belief or a priori knowledge. Priors describe the general probability of encountering a particular class. For example, we might say that the prior probability that a person is male versus female is 0.5. We can obtain these class priors by consulting domain experts, or estimate them from data. (If you're estimating class priors from training data, it's important that your sample is drawn i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) from a representative sample of the population.)\n",

Even if mammogram in this world detects breast cancer in 8 out of 10 cases, while returning a false positive on a woman without breast cancer in only 1 out of 10 cases, there will still be a hundred thousand false positives for every real case of cancer detected. The original probability that a woman has cancer is so extremely low that, although a positive result on the mammogram does increase the estimated probability, the probability isn't increased to certainty or even \"a noticeable chance\"; the probability goes from 1:1,000,000 to 1:100,000.\n",

If this were the case her estimated probability of having cancer would have been revised drastically downward after she got a positive result on her mammogram---an 80% chance of having cancer is a lot less than 99.9999%! If you administer mammograms to ten million women in this world, around eight million women with breast cancer will get correct positive results, while one woman without breast cancer will get false positive results. Thus, if you got a positive mammogram in this alternate universe, your chance of having cancer would go from 99.9999% up to 99.999987%. That is, your chance of being healthy would go from 1:1,000,000 down to 1:8,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two extreme examples help demonstrate that the mammogram result doesn't replace your old information about the patient's chance of having cancer; the mammogram slides the estimated probability in the direction of the result. A positive result slides the original probability upward; a negative result slides the probability downward. For example, in the original problem where 1% of the women have cancer, 80% of women with cancer get positive mammograms, and 9.6% of women without cancer get positive mammograms, a positive result on the mammogram slides the 1% chance upward to 7.8%."
