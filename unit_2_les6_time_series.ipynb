    "One approach to this analysis asserts that all time series can be broken into three components so that Y=m+s+e, where \"Y\" is the series, \"m\" is the trend, \"s\" is the seasonal component and \"e\" is random noise. The trend component can be thought of as longer-term change and is often calculated my taking a moving average over a certain time span.The seasonal component is short-term periodic fluctuations that are measured by averaging detrended observations (Y-m) that are separated by a constant number of observations. For example, you can think of the price of gasoline as having a long-term trend (say declining) which experiences regular increases every twelve months when people start to take vacations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is known as exponential smoothing. The idea behind this method is to forecast predictions based on a weighted average of the most recent observations. The weighting is typically a geometrically declining series that sums to 1, so the most recent observations are given the most weight. The result is a smoothed series that reflects the pattern of the most recent observations. New observations are then seen as a function of this smooth series and the most recent observation. The most common application, the Holt-Winters methods, also incorporates trend terms and a seasonal component.\n",

    "A more involved approach to time-series analysis is the ARIMA method. The acronym stands for \"Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average\", the main components of the model. The general idea behind this model is that a series can be expressed as a function of its most recent observations (\"auto-regressive\" indicates a regression of an observation on itself, or more specifically, running a regression on an observation using previous observations as explanatory variables) as well as a trend component of the forecast errors (moving average).\n",
    "\n",
    "ARIMA models assume that the time-series is stationary, which in this context, means that the mean, variance and autocorrelation does not change over time. In practice this means that a differenced series (the result of subtracting a set of observations in a series with a previous observation of a fixed time lag) is often used to model an ARIMA process. Adding back the difference to get a model for the original series is considered \"integrating.\""

In modern packages this is often decided by examining the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots.

The PACF plots the correlation of an observation and the observation with a given lag, but with the linear relationships of all intervening observations controlled for.\n",

The results obtained by using non-stationary time series may be spurious in that they may indicate a relationship between two variables where one does not exist. In order to receive consistent, reliable results, the non-stationary data needs to be transformed into stationary data. In contrast to the non-stationary process that has a variable variance and a mean that does not remain near, or returns to a long-run mean over time, the stationary process reverts around a constant long-term mean and has a constant variance independent of time."
