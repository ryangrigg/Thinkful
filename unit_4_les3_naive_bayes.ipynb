    "The probabilistic model of Naive Bayes classifiers is based on Bayes’ Theorem, while the adjective “naive” comes from the assumption that the features in the data are mutually independent. (In other words, the features in our data aren't like Barack Obama being elected President and Joe Biden being elected Vice President.) More often than not, the features in the data aren't mutually independent, but Naive Bayes classifiers still perform well, and they perform especially well on small sample sizes, which is one of their main advantages. In this lesson, we'll look at the probability model of the Naive Bayes classifier and apply the concept to construct a classifier.\n",

    "Very simply, a Naive Bayes classifier will take an observation, compute the Bayesian probability of each possible hypothesis, and select the hypothesis with the highest probability (the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) hypothesis) to classify the observation."
